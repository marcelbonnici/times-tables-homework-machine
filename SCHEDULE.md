## Week 3:
### Goal: Perfect the CV Readings

What Was Accomplished: Created a work-in-progress algorithm that performs splicing better than concatenating fractions of a worksheet

What Needs Improvement: The exemplary worksheet has 4 written like an upside-down "h", which tesseract cannot detect. To solve the issue, machine learning or training tesseract will likely be adopted.

## Week 2:
### Goals:
a) Circuit Schematic

b) Find where to write the answers and output to serial

c) Increase reading accuracy of math problems
## Week 1: The Prototype
### Goals:
X Reassembling the prototype after transportation

X Figuring out how to make the machine more "from scratch" mechatronically
